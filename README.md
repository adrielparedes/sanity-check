# Sanity Check

- `version.sh` contains an export with the version to test.
- `download.sh` download the version that is declared in `version.sh` to binaries folder
- `unzip.sh` unzip the version that is declared in `version.sh` from binaries folder to distributions folder
- `start.sh` start the version that is declared in `version.sh`
